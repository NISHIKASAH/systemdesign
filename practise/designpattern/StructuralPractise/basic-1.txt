STRUCTURE PATTERN 

---------------ADAPTER PATTERN --------------------
ADAPTEE ------ADAPTOR ---------CLIENT
idea - convert interface to another  ,to make it compatible 
structure - 
-TARGET - interface of phone (iPhone)
- ADAPTEE -  class of charge (android) - TO BE CONVERTED 
-ADAPTER - androidToIphone  - to do conversion 
-CLIENT

----------------------BRIDGE PATTERN --------------------
IMPLEMENTATION ---------- ABSTARCTION

idea -  separate abstraction from implementation , allowing both work independently.

STRUCTURE 
-abstraction (Remote)
-concreate abstraction 
-abstract implementor (tv)
-concrete implementor

example - Tv(implementor) Interface - sonyTV : Device(concreate implementor) - Remote(abstract) - basicRemote(concreate abstract) 


-------------------------COMPOSITE PATERN-----------------------
     OBJECT (component)
     /    \
  obj(leaf)  composite obj (tree of obj) 

idea - allow  to compose/combine object into tree-like structure . 
STRUCTURE 
COMPONENT - interaface /abstract class
LEAF-concreate class
COMPOSITE - hold child components (both leaf and composite) 

example : employees(interface) - developer(leaf) - manager(composite){can have further employees  and manager}
folder container folder or file .

---------------------------DECORATOR PATTERN --------------------

idea - adding new behaviour or reponsibility to object , without affecting the base functionality/feature . 

STRUCTURE 
abstract product /component (coffee)
concreate product  (basic coffe ) 
abstract decorator (decorator)
concreate decorator (milkdecorator) 

example - coffee class -basic coffee-decorator - milkdecorator

----------------------------Facade pattern -----------------------

COMPLEX BUILDING ------- ACCUMLATING ALL ---------CLIENT 
idea - hide underlying complexity and provide simpler interface to user . 
STRUCTURE 
-FACADE - manage high level method and subsystem object creation 
-SUBSYSTEM - implement the actual complexity 
-CLIENT -get simple template  . 

subsystem  - car creation - engine , tires and all creation done 
facade - use this to create construct car 
client - simple use car .



---------------------PROXY PATTERN------------------------

idea - a object  has a access controlled to another object . 
use in access control , resource-intensive(expernsive) object , add function like caching , access control .
types - 
virtual - control access ,  when obj creation is expensive .
remote - represent obj in different address space .
protection- object has control access base on permission . 
smart - add new behaviour to object .

example - loading real time of high-resolution from disk can be slow , 
we use proxyImage  till real image is not available.

-----------------------FLYWEIGHT PATTERN----------------------

idea - reduce memory usage by sharing data among similar object .
example  text editor - for every character  , instead of creating new object reusing char and only store positing and formatting externally .
