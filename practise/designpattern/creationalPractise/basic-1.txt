Design pattern 

1.CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTER - focus on creation that best suite situation 
make system independent of Object creation , compose and representation .

Singleton - ensure single instance exist in class 
Factory method - delegates(assign / refer) objection creation to subclass 
Abstract factory method - produce families of related object 
builder - build complex object step by step .
prototype - create object  by cloning existing object . 

--------------SINGLETON-----------------

-STRUCTURE -
constructor is private and empty .
static function use to created instance . 

-Key points to remember- 
*single instance  , global access to instance .
*constructor private to prevent external instantiation .
*static key - no need to create object , directly call function.

---------------------FACTORY METHOD------------
-STRUCTURE- (SINGLE PRODUCT CONSIDERED)
abstract PRODUCT - object declared 
concreate product - type of object creation decided by subclass 
abstract CREATOR /factory - factory for the type creation declared
concreate creator / factory - object created for the type .

-Key points to remember- 
*Single object creation is considered in factory method.
*An interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type
*instead of calling constructor , client class factory for creation of product .

advantage
-loosely couple 
-flexible 
-scalable 
-follows Program to an interface, not an implementation  principle

-----------------------Abstract Factory Method--------------
idea - use for creating related families / dependent product (Two or 
more product involved) .
important - It allows switching between families
STRUCTURE (MULTIPLE PRODUCT CONSIDERED) 
abstract factory - factory for both theme
concrete factory - individual theme product 
abstract product 
concreate product 

example - dark  and light theme UI for BUTTON AND CHECKBOX. 

----------------------------BUILDER PATTERN--------------------
Idea - create complex product step by step . 
separate constructor from  object representation ( same constructor 
can be use diff representation ) 
STRUCTURE 
-product 
-builder ( abstract builder) - create process for building product
-concreate builder - actually build product 
-director - handle building process using builder class
-client - handle direct product creation using concreate builder.

example - meal (as product) - vegMeal (steps in builder) -implementation of veg meal prep(concreate builder) - director(handle veg meal creation using builder class)


-------------------- PROTOTYPE PATTERN ------------------
-idea  - create object from template (PROTOTYPE)
- COPY other obj creation bcoz creation is expensive
-use when many config of obj is needed
-copy done is shallow copy
-.Clone() use to clone object
STRUCTURE 
- abstract prototype- interface with clone func
-concreate-  prototype - clone implementation
-client 

deep copy - new instance is created , changes does not affect original object .
shallow copy - copy only reference of nested object , changes affect original also.

MEMBERWISECLONE() is use to perform shallow clone
